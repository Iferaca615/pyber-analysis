# Overview and Purpose
We were assigned to create a data frame for ride share data by city type.  This challenge utilized Pandas as well as matplotlib in order to create a visualization for the data collected between different city types in 2019 from January to April.  We then created a multiple line chart in order to showcase the trends in the total weekly fares between the different city types; Urban, Suburban and Rural, during this time period.

# Data Visualization: 

1) **Total weekly fare by city line chart:**

## analysis:
	* Urban cities bring in the highest weekly fares compared to suburban and rural areas.
	* Rural areas bring in more profit between March and April.
	* Suburban areas see a significant spike in their weekly fares in late February and March.
	* There is always a higher demand in urban cities making its total weekly fares relatively consistent, but it does see a drop in fares around January.


2) **Challenge Summary Data Frame:**
![summary_df_chal](analysis/summary_df_chal.png)
## analysis:
	* Urban cities have the highest amount of rides and brings in almost 10x the amount of fares compared to Rural areas and almost 2x the total fares of Suburban areas.
	* The average fare per ride:
		- Rural: $34.62
		- Suburban: $30.97
		- Urban: $24.53
	* The average fare per driver is almost 3x higher in Rural areas than Urban areas.
	* There are significantly less drivers in Rural areas than there are in urban areas, with the total drivers in Suburban areas falls at around 490, closer to the total in rural areas.

# Suggestions:

In general it is to be expected that Urban areas will have a higher weekly fare due to the setting as well as the demographics in the area.  Therefore, investing into more densely populated urban areas, or even up and coming cities would be beneficial for increasing the total weekly fares even more.

* Rural areas find themselves being way less trafficked meaning that fares will fall during times where travel in unnecessary.  Being that many people in these areas have cars, travel using ride share services is at an all time low during the winter/colder months.  However, rural areas have very high margins for profit if more time is spent investing in these places.

* The demographics in suburban areas usually indicates that there would be a demand for ride sharing services.  However, in these areas accessibility is very important meaning that the prices for fares need to remain at a price where this service is accessible for cities that may be underserved and in need of this service.
